			<h3 >Third culture kid, Ex-Chemical Engineer.<br>I build and spill things.<br> Currently looking for a group of awesome people to make some cool stuff with.
			<h2 style="margin-bottom: 50px">Or.. The Longer Version :)</h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 40px">Born & raised in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an"><strong>Xi’an</strong></a>, growing up in Boston and Houston,  I’m currently a senior at Carnegie Mellon University. From a family heavily influenced by engineering culture, I started in college thinking I wanted to be an engineer just like my father. Not until end of my sophomore year, when I randomly came across one design class, I was awed by the world that I never thought would have a place for me.</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 40px" >Two years later, I’m on my way completing my studies in both <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/"><strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong></a> & Chemical Engineering at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cmu.edu/"><strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong></a>.As a “noob” in the Design World, I move quickly by learning from my peers and own failures. I don't believe in getting things perfect the first try, and I think it’s the courage to embrace failures, curiosities, and attitude to keep trying set designers great, like many of the folks I have met in the past </p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 40px">Last year, I took some time off from school to explore my life as a designer. I interned as an Interaction Designer at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fantasy.co"><strong>F-i</strong></a> where I co-created a lighter version of <a target="_blank" href="https://invis.io/Z280WL1TX"><strong>The Weather Channel App</strong></a>. I worked as a product design intern at start-up Brain.LLC, where I participated in designing a new browser experience that doesn’t require searching. I also tried the life as an Industrial engineer at <a target="_blank" href="http://us.pg.com/"><strong>Proctor & Gamble</strong></a> where I applied the concept of Human-centered design to solve industrial engineering problems.</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 40px">I’m currently looking for an awesome group of people to build something great with. I’m hoping that you will encourage me to try different things, maybe fail a little, and help me become a kick-ass product designer like you probably already are. If you are interested in my work, or just want to chat about my life as a designer, an engineer, or a world traveler, don't be shy to <a href="mailto:helenhong1224@gmail.com"><strong>Say Hi</strong></a> :) </p>
