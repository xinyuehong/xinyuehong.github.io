			<div><h2>I went on an 8 month long Exploratory journey.</h2>
			</div>
 			<p>In the past eight months, I decided to take a break from school and went into the real world to learn from working. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to work at two design studios, Fantasy Interactive & Junior.io as a design appretence. During my time there, I worked with multiple different companies ranging from enterprises such as the weather channel & eBay, to start-ups such as source clear, Brain & clearspend. </p>

			<h2>The Weather Channel</h2>
			<p>While working with the weather channel, I was mainly tasked to design two parts. The cross-device portal of "Cold & Flu", and the Andoird Lite App where the Weather Channel aimed to design a lighter version targeting at companies with limited wi-fi access. In this project, I created the mobile,pad,desktop view of the cold & flue portion, and rapid-protoyped the Android lite App in 3 different languages with Invision.</p>

			<h2>eBay: The Shoptbot</h2>
			<p>During my time at Junior, we partnered with eBay to help create eBay ShopBot, an AI-powered commerce bot on Facebook Messenger. Users can browse ShopBot's curated collections, conversationally search for something speciic, or use the image recognition feature to find items within eBay's broad inventory. A marketing strategy we concepted was where for 10 days we hid a chance to win Snap Spectacles within ShopBot's collections to encourage user of the bot's features. Some numbers: An average increased daily usership of 25% and the last day of the promotion broke the launch record for number of users in a day.</p>

			<div><h2>Source-Clear</h2></div>
			<p>Source clear is a start-up company that wants developers to rethink their approach to software security. In this project, we were tasked to simplify the user experience to make it easier for developers to keep track of and have a better understanding on the risk in their usage of different libraries. For this project, my focus was on redesigning some portion of the repositary pages, including the repo pages, part of the dashboard, and the visual design of the overview page.</p>

	 		<p class="pbetweenh3">While each gallery can provide an interesting experience, museum-goers often have difficulty connecting experiences across museums. Experiences within museums can become very isolated and solitary</p> -->



			<div><h2>Much more & my take-aways</h2>
			<p>During the 8 months, I explored my passion in human-centered design, strengthened my problem solving skills and realized what I want: To Create. I did a lot more than the things I have shown above, yet there's so much more I learned from the past 8 months.</p>
			<h3>Be okay wth dealing with Ambiguity. Ask why.</h3>
			<p>Working at small design studiors or startups require fast decision making and often-time there's no specific researchers. I was often-time challenged and by keeping asking myself why, I make sure I follow my train of thoughts clearly and making the best decision as well as I could given the constraints.</p>
			<h3>Forget you are a student, but also take advantage of it :)</h3>
			<p>Work environment is a lot harsher than school. Yep. You are often time questioned. Being confident is the first step to push yourself forward. So forget about you are a student, push back when you should. Yet take advantage of the fact of being student, ask questions shameless :) </p>
			<h3>Pay Attention to details, details, details.</h3> 
			<p>Through my internship, I used motion design intensively for rapid prototyping because it was the only way to inform engineers both from U.S team and China team to keep updated with design solutions. Through conducting working prototype, I was able to speak more clearly about my design, so did my design become more credential.  Also, it really really sped up the building process!!</p>
			<h3>I actually missed school...</h3>
			<p>umm. kinda :D Gotta make the best out of it in my last semester :) </p>
