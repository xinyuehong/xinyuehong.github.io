			<div><h2>An Exploratory journey of 8 months...</h2>
			</div>
 			<p>In the past eight months, I decided to take a break from school and went into the real world to learn from working. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to work at two design studios, Fantasy Interactive & Junior.io as a design appretence. During my time there, I worked with multiple different companies ranging from enterprises such as the weather channel & eBay, to start-ups such as source clear, Brain & clearspend. </p>

			<h2>The Weather Channel</h2>
			<p>While working with the weather channel, I was mainly tasked to design two parts. The cross-device portal of "Cold & Flu", and the Andoird Lite App where the Weather Channel aimed to design a lighter version targeting at companies with limited wi-fi access. In this project, I created the mobile,pad,desktop view of the cold & flue portion, and rapid-protoyped the Android lite App in 3 different languages with Invision.</p>

			<h2>eBay: The Shoptbot</h2>
			<p>During my time at Junior, we partnered with eBay to help create eBay ShopBot, an AI-powered commerce bot on Facebook Messenger. Users can browse ShopBot's curated collections, conversationally search for something speciic, or use the image recognition feature to find items within eBay's broad inventory. A marketing strategy we concepted was where for 10 days we hid a chance to win Snap Spectacles within ShopBot's collections to encourage user of the bot's features. Some numbers: An average increased daily usership of 25% and the last day of the promotion broke the launch record for number of users in a day.</p>
