			<div><h2>A community network tool to foster meaningful relationships among neighboring dog owners and dog lovers.</h2>
			</div>
 			<p>Along with Chris Liu, we concept a communication tool to build a trusted local neighboring community centered on dogs for neighboring dog owners and dog lovers. The purpose of such an application is to foster meaningful relationships among the stakeholders with the hope that a strong bond could be formed among them to alleviate problems that many dog owners encounter, such as Pet Sitting.</p>

			<div><h2>Exploratory Research: "What do you do about your dogs when you are away?"</h2></div>
			<p>After coming cross these numbers, we started the research with “What do you do about your dogs when you are away?” In the course of 2 months, we chatted with more than 50 dogs owners, and collected data from more than 120 pet owners to learn about their pains & concerns.  We studied existing products, and learned that the current pet sitting service is fails in providing the trust layer and could be expensive.</p>

				<!-- <p>Artbyte is a concept initially came up by Ali to help museum goers understand their own taste in Art. Ali approached us for help on re-validating and re-constructing his idea.

	 		<p class="pbetweenh3">In terms of art, access is limited to the museum or gallery, making the experience of viewing art exclusive. In fact, some of the most innovative and creative art is proprietary, making it difficult to engage with regularly.</p>

	 		<p class="pbetweenh3">While each gallery can provide an interesting experience, museum-goers often have difficulty connecting experiences across museums. Experiences within museums can become very isolated and solitary</p>

			<!-- <h2>Rapid Prototyping of ideas</h2>
			<p>We used mainly two ways, storyboarding and experimental workshops to rapid prototype our ideas. From speed-dating,
			we heard “I love the idea of creating my own visual contents based on museum experience but it seems like a lot of work”
			“I don’t think I’m creative enough to do it.”
			We learned People loved the idea of sharing and finding Artbytes using augmented reality and find it a novel and exciting experience, yet it takes a while to let users understand the concept of Augmented Reality. One concern we heard is that most people are afraid of the “creating” process would be complicated on a device and they are not creative enough to make their own art
			</p>
			<img src="img/janicea.png" alt="" class="eightywidth">
			<p>We then tested different ideas to see if cropping would be the easiest way to create art and if this interaction would actually help users think of what they like about art. From these little workshops, we learned that cropping method does help users think actively about the art while creating and gave users confidence in creation process."this is pretty fun actually." "Definitely not as hard as I thought it would be".</p>

		<!-- 	<div><h2>Final Solution, For Now.<br></div>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px"></p>
			<p>The first version of the workflow of Artbytes used to be very linear and stringent. A lot of steps were mandatory and little affordances were given.The vocabularies we had such as “Artbytes” and “AR show” were hard to be understood by first users.</p>
			<img src="img/version3a.png" alt="" class="fullwidth">
			<p class="pbetweenimgs">While I brainstormed six different ideas to minimize the steps users have to go through to post exhibitions, I held a body-storming session with my friends to mimic different possible use case scenarios. The practice was helpful as in it let me focus on the option of “creating directly from my gallery" that further impacted the overall information architecture.</p>
			<img src="img/chrisa.png" alt="" class="fullwidth">
			<img src="img/explorea.png" alt="" class=""> -->



			<div><h2>Meet Petbor:Key Final Decisions, for now.</h2>
			<p>After 3 rounds of user testings, and millions of times of changing in information architecture, we decided to make a mobile app with these final design decisions incorporated.</p>
			<h3>Onboarding</h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 40px">The process of creating an ArtByte involves first selecting an image from your gallery or taking a picture with your phone’s camera. The user then crops out part of the image by outlining the desired section with their fingers. we found that users considered the two-step process tedious and time-consuming. Participants became frustrated that the app repeatedly crashed during the cropping process, particularly during the fine crop process</p><br>
			<img src="img/researcha.png" alt="" class="eightywidth">

			<h3 style="margin-top: 80px">Self-initiated location based events</h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 40px">Artbytes, Composition, AR show -> Artbytes, Megabytes -> Artbytes, Exhibition that conveys the concept of showcasing the user'sw work.</p>
			<img src="img/researcha.png" alt="" class="eightywidth">

			<h3 style="margin-top: 80px">Discussion panel to provoke conversations within the community</h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 40px">We decided to remove the mandatory step of combining ArtBytes, allowing for more flexibility in the creation process. The first terms were updated to be ArtBytes, MegaBytes, and Exhibition. From medium-fidelity testing our group found that the original terms did not provide a consistent feeling because ArtBytes is not a real English word,while AR Show is an acronym.</p>
			<img src="img/researcha.png" alt="" class="eightywidth">

 			<h3 style="margin-top: 80px">Focus on strengthening your network</h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 40px">Features: Join friends for a walk, keep updated with daily activities, event suggestions, always changing content recommendations</p>
			<img src="img/researcha.png" alt="" class="eightywidth">

			<h3 style="margin-top: 80px">Message system for easy help sending</h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 40px">We tried many different visual compositions and finalized decided on a more minimal visuals to let users focus on the content they are creating. (We were so in shock when the Instagram new design came out a week later after our final presentation!)</p>
			<img src="img/researcha.png" alt="" class="eightywidth">

			<h3 style="margin-top: 80px">Blah!</h3>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 40px">User testing results and heuristic evaluation revealed that the existing application’s workflow is stringent and confusing for the users. There were too many mandatory steps for users to make an Exhibition, throughout which users were brought back to home screen without a clear affordance about the next steps. For example, the users would create an ArtByte</p>
