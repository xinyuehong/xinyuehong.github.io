			<div><h2>A community network tool designed for neighboring dog owners and dog lovers.</h2>
			</div>
 			<p>Along with Chris Liu, we concepted a communication tool to build a trusted local neighboring community centered on dogs for neighboring dog owners, yet also invited to neihgboring dog lovers. The purpose of such an application is to foster meaningful relationships among the stakeholders with the hope that a strong bond could be formed among them to alleviate problems that many dog owners encounter, such as Pet Sitting.</p>
			<img src="petbor/overview.png" alt="" class="fullwidth">

			<div><h2>Initial Problem:<br> "What do you do about your dogs when you are away?"</h2></div>
			<p>$400 Billions a year, yet 2M dog a year with depression attributed to lack of social interaction. After coming cross these numbers, we started the research with “What do you do about your dogs when you are away?” In the course of 2 months, we chatted with more than 40 dogs owners and dog lovers, and collected data from more than 120 pet owners to learn about their pains points & behaviiors. We also studied existing products, and learned that the current pet sitting service fails in providing the trust layer and could potentially be very expensive. Yet, we found that pet sitting is more of a problem for new owners and for owners who recently moved to a strange environment. They face more problems other than pet sitting.</p>

			<div><h2>Current behaviors & values of Key stakeholders</h2></div>
			<div><h3>I1. Experienced dog owners normally have a few to-go people and find the problem least stressful.<h3></div>
<!-- 			<p class="pbetweenh3">"I'm extremely lucky to have a circuit of friends with..."</p>

 -->		<div><h3>I2. The natural relationship of trading pet sitting duties among friends/neighbors<h3></div>
			<div><h3>I3. Try out pet sitters recommended by other dog owners friends<h3></div>
			<div><h3>I4. Edge Case: "My dogs don't get along with other dogs"</h3>
			<div><h3>I5. Newly moved & new dog owners have more needs than simply pet sitting.</h3>

	
			<div><h2>Insight: <br>Problem in petting is due by lack, or limitation in a trusted supporting circle.</h2></div>
			<p>Due to the lack of connections, the pet sitting problem is most salient among newly-became and newly-moved dog owners. On the other hand, experienced local owners also have trouble expanding their limited connections.</p>


			<div><h2>Reframe the problem:<br> How can we help dog owners build their supporting circle?</h2>
			<p>We started answering this question by asking what dog owners' current supporting circle like. Who are they friends with and why do they trust these people, we used a stakeholder value map to make sense of such a supprting circle. We heard: "Easy to access", "Some Petting Experience", "Someone who geniunely like/care about my dog", "Families", "Friends","Neighbors"</p>

			<div><h2>Opportunity Space: <br>Build a local community centered around dog owners, yet doesn't exclude pet lovers.</h2></div>
			<P>After we learned about our stakeholders’ values, we discovered that other than the motivation of finding a pet sitter, there are more potential benefits for pet owners to expand their local connections with other owners. From here, we saw an opportunity to connect local pet owners and lovers and potentially have them form the supporting circle given that if a stronger community is built among local pet owners, many problems including pet sitting will be solved.</p>

			<h2>Concept Validation:<br>Do dog owners want to meet and be friends with their dog neighbors?</h2>
			<p>We had a lot of questions such as with whom do they become friends with? What's difficult about it? Which ones do they want to be friends with? And presented. However, we recognized that the main barrier for dog owners to make connections is the <strong>difficulty of making commitment to meet</strong>. To help them overcome this specific barrier, we designed our final solution that aims to construct meaningful relationship between local owners.</p>
			
					
			<div>
				<div><h2>Prototyping key touch points:<br>"Meet & Stay Connected" </h2></div>
				<p>From our research learnings, we decided that all these touch points have to happen in a manner that is Light-weight, effortless and organic to lower the barrier of entry, yet interesting enough for dog owners to be able to attend.</p>
				<h3>Touch point 1: Meeting</h3>
				<p class="pbetweenh3" >Potential Ideation: online, offline meeting</p>

				<h3 style="margin-top:5rem">Touch point 2: prolong the relationship</h3>
				<p class="pbetweenh3">Potential Ideation:promoted content, event, walk together...</p>

			<div><h2>Key Final Decisions,for now.</h2>
			<p>After 3 rounds of user testings, and millions of times of changing in information architecture, we decided to make a mobile app with these final design decisions incorporated.</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Design is never finished and we are still in the current process of revisiting everything. During the design process, we stayed close to our users so we designed with them. We changed our ideas many times based on our user’s feedback and worked on the information archtecture millions of times to make sure everything is more straightforward. Here are some key iterations we made for some features. </p>
