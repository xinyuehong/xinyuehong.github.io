			<div><h2>A community network tool designed for neighboring dog owners and dog lovers.</h2>
			</div>
 			<p>Along with Chris Liu, we concepted a communication tool to build a trusted local neighboring community centered on dogs for neighboring dog owners, yet also invited to neihgboring dog lovers. The purpose of such an application is to foster meaningful relationships among the stakeholders with the hope that a strong bond could be formed among them to alleviate problems that many dog owners encounter, such as Pet Sitting.</p>
			<img src="img/explaina.png" alt="" class="fullwidth">
			<div><h2>Initial Problem: Difficulty in finding pet sitters</h2></div>
			<p>After coming cross these numbers, we started the research with “What do you do about your dogs when you are away?” In the course of 2 months, we chatted with more than 40 dogs owners and dog lovers, and collected data from more than 120 pet owners to learn about their pains points & behaviiors. We also studied existing products, and learned that the current pet sitting service fails in providing the trust layer and could potentially be very expensive. Yet, we found that pet sitting is more of a problem for new owners and for owners who recently moved to a strange environment. They face more problems other than pet sitting.</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Design is never finished and we are still in the current process of revisiting everything. During the design process, we stayed close to our users so we designed with them. We changed our ideas many times based on our user’s feedback and worked on the information archtecture millions of times to make sure everything is more straightforward. </p>
