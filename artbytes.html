			<div><h2>Spring 2016,<br> we brought our client Ali Momeni's concept of Artbytes to life.</h2>
			</div>
 			<p>Art Museums provide wonderful experience for museum goers to enjoy the beauty of art, inspired by the power of master pieces. Yet this engagement tends to temporary and vanishes at the end of the trip. What's lacking from the current museum going experience? We present you Arbytes, an IOS App that encourages museum-goers to rethink what they see at art museums, create their own visual contents through simple cropping and combination, and share with the public using augmented reality. In this project, our main goals were to validate our Client's idea, improve the design based on existing features and ultimately give museum goers the confidence to be creative through simple and intuitive  design.</p>

				<!-- <h2>Background: A Client Based Product Redesign</h2> -->
				<!-- <p>Artbyte is a concept initially came up by Ali to help museum goers understand their own taste in Art. Ali approached us for help on re-validating and re-constructing his idea. After running heuristic evaluation and first round of user testing on the initial app, we found that the initial version of Artbytes has very low usability and the overall workflow was confusing for users</p> -->
			</div>


			<div><h2>Defining Painpoints:<br> Museum going Experience is passive</h2>
			</div>
			<p class="pbetweenh3">Since the initial idea wasn't backed with any data or user research, the team started the project by understanding what exactly the pain points are in current museum/art veiwing experience. We started the redesign process with relooking into the problems, After 20+ interviews, countless trips to art museums/galleries and became "stalkers" for ten weeks straight, we defined these problem spaces and also found these insights.</p>
	<!-- 		<img src="img/researcha.png" alt="" class="eightywidth">

	 		<p class="pbetweenh3">Although the experience is engaging in the moment, visitors leave the museum space with all this documentation but are unlikely to reflect on it after</p>
	 		<div><h3>P2. Exclusive Art</h3></div>
	 		<p class="pbetweenh3">In terms of art, access is limited to the museum or gallery, making the experience of viewing art exclusive. In fact, some of the most innovative and creative art is proprietary, making it difficult to engage with regularly.</p>

	 		<p class="pbetweenh3">From our expert interviews, we learned that viewers are easily engaged when new technology is embedded in the exhibition experience. Yet it must encourage careful thought and personal expression. Technology can often be distracting and take away from the purpose of a museum experience. </p>

					<h3>Temporary Engagement</h3><br>
					<p>going to a museum can be extremely passive. Oftentimes, individuals in museums walk through exhibits and document things they enjoy by taking pictures, jotting down information, or sharing their thoughts with a friend. Although the experience is engaging in the moment, visitors leave the museum space with all this documentation, but is unlikely to reflect on it after.</p>

				<h2>Design Insights & Ideation</h2>
				<p>During our preliminary search,  we focused on understanding the population of museum-goers and how technology has enhanced the museum experience in the past. Beyond gaining an understanding of our audience, we found, through expert interviews and a thorough literature review, that The use of technology to be worthwhile, it must encourage careful thought and personal expression. From what we learned in the past, technology can often be distracting and take away from the purpose of a museum experience. These are two goals of art-seekers, and also goals of the institution.It must leverage existing museum-goer behavior. This includes social aspects as well as personal aspects, including documentation of experiences through photos. 
				Based on the existing App and research, we brainstormed and came up with 8 potential different features such as Artbytes grabbing & sharing, virtual reality gallery for viewing.</p>

				<p>After our design synthesis, we thought Artbytes could be a way to help people document their thoughts and be creative. Yet we need to create more motivation to onboard our users. We came up with 8 ideas centered around how Artbytes could be improved, and using Augmented reality to find artbytes created is  one of them. We decided to use two ways storyboarding and experimental workshops to rapidly prototype our ideas. From these tests, we learned that people love the idea of Augmented reality and are eager to share. </p>

			<!-- <h2>Rapid Prototyping of ideas</h2>
			<p>We used mainly two ways, storyboarding and experimental workshops to rapid prototype our ideas. From speed-dating,
			we heard “I love the idea of creating my own visual contents based on museum experience but it seems like a lot of work”
			“I don’t think I’m creative enough to do it.”
			We learned People loved the idea of sharing and finding Artbytes using augmented reality and find it a novel and exciting experience, yet it takes a while to let users understand the concept of Augmented Reality. One concern we heard is that most people are afraid of the “creating” process would be complicated on a device and they are not creative enough to make their own art
			</p>
			<img src="img/janicea.png" alt="" class="eightywidth">
			<p>We then tested different ideas to see if cropping would be the easiest way to create art and if this interaction would actually help users think of what they like about art. From these little workshops, we learned that cropping method does help users think actively about the art while creating and gave users confidence in creation process."this is pretty fun actually." "Definitely not as hard as I thought it would be".</p>

			<!-- <hr> -->
			<div>
				<div><h2>Conclusion:<br> Creativity doesn't have to<br> mean reinventing the wheel.</h2></div>
				<p >We also held little workshops and conducted think-aloud interviews to test if cropping would be a barrier free way to create art and if this interaction would actually help users think of what they like about art. From these  workshops, we learned that cropping method does help users think actively about the art while creating and gave users confidence in the creation process."This is pretty fun actually." "Definitely not as hard as I thought it would be".</p>

			</div>

			<div><h2>Refocus the problem:<br> Push for simple yet intuitive<br>interaction to lower the barrier of entry</h2></div>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">After speed dating and Art-making workshops, the team decided to put the whole design focus on prototyping the Artbytes creation and Gallery creation experience as we heard concerns that creating art might be the hardest part/most confusing part on a digital platform. We wanted to lower the level of entry of creation to the minimum to give users confidence in practicing their creativity and making this App for every museum goer. After 5 iterations, 50+ usability testings and 3 different prototyping tools, we came to something that's a lot more sense making.
				<!-- We tried paper prototype, marvel prototype, & finally code based prototpye, went through more than five rounds of iterations, think aloud & task based user testings & body-storming with more than 30 potential users. --></p>
			<p>The first version of the workflow of Artbytes used to be very linear and stringent. A lot of steps were mandatory and little affordances were given.The vocabularies we had such as “Artbytes” and “AR show” were hard to be understood by first users.</p>
			<img src="img/version3a.png" alt="" class="fullwidth">
			<p class="pbetweenimgs">While I brainstormed six different ideas to minimize the steps users have to go through to post exhibitions, I held a body-storming session with my friends to mimic different possible use case scenarios. The practice was helpful as in it let me focus on the option of “creating directly from my gallery" that further impacted the overall information architecture.</p>

			<h2>Key Final IXD decisions</h2>
			<h3>Simple Cropping Edge Tracing Method</h3>
			<p><!-- The process of creating an ArtByte involves first selecting an image from your gallery or taking a picture with your phone’s camera. The user then crops out part of the image by outlining the desired section with their fingers. we found that users considered the two-step process tedious and time-consuming.  -->Participants became frustrated that the app repeatedly crashed during the cropping process, particularly during the fine crop process, because none of their work had been saved. However, the bigger problem was that users did not understand why the app included two cropping stages. <!-- Because edge detection was buggy, and it was difficult to get an accurate outline in the coarse crop, users thought the distinction between coarse and fine crop was ambiguous. --> We decided to go with the only simple cropping edge tracing method as participants found that this method was the most intuitive and that they were used to this method of cropping since it is similar to cropping experience in real life.</p><br>
			<h3>Naming of ambiguous vocabs</h3>
			<p>Artbytes, Composition, AR show -> Artbytes, Megabytes -> Artbytes, Exhibition that conveys the concept of showcasing the user'sw work.<p>
			<h3>Removal of Combining as a mandatary step and create one single gallery </h3>
			<p>We decided to remove the mandatory step of combining ArtBytes, allowing for more flexibility in the creation process. <!-- The first terms were updated to be ArtBytes, MegaBytes, and Exhibition. From medium-fidelity testing our group found that the original terms did not provide a consistent feeling because ArtBytes is not a real English word,while AR Show is an acronym. Users also expressed difficulty understanding the relationship between an ArtByte and a composition made of ArtBytes. In the first few versions, only "Megabytes"/composition could be shared and the idea of what's sharable or not causing users to believe that creating a single ArtByte and combining ArtBytes are two completely separate processes when in reality, these two processes should be connected. In addtion,  -->Users did not know whether an Exhibition was meant to share a single ArtByte or combined ArtBytes, creating a mental model that posting an Exhibition is unrelated to creating ArtBytes. In reality, users need to see this connection to create ArtBytes that suit particular locations for sharing. We created a single gallery for ArtBytes and removing the terminology that distinguishes between a single ArtByte and combined ArtBytes to share. Users are now able to develop a more accurate model of what they are creating and sharing with others by having a gallery with everything they have created and everything that can be shared. <!-- Although the process of creating an ArtByte and combining ArtBytes is less linear than the original application, users now felt that their single ArtByte provides value because they have the ability to share it with others. -->
 			<h3>Augmented Reality for Exhibition posting</h3>
			<p>We decided to add the exhibition as a way to motivate people to create/share by bringing out a much more novel experience like they have never had.</p>
			<h3>Clean minimal visuals</h3>
			<p>We tried many different visual compositions and finalized decided on a more minimal visuals to let users focus on the content they are creating. (We were so in shock when the Instagram new design came out a week later after our final presentation!)<p>
			<h3>A much more dynamic Workflow</h3>
			<p>User testing results and heuristic evaluation revealed that the existing application’s workflow is stringent and confusing for the users. There were too many mandatory steps for users to make an Exhibition, throughout which users were brought back to home screen without a clear affordance about the next steps.<!--  For example, the users would create an ArtByte and they had to mandatorily create a composition by going back to the home screen in order to make an ExhibitionIn the final version, the workflow eliminates the step of creating the composition and allows the users to make an Exhibition with single ArtByte. After creating an ArtByte, the users can now select the Artbyte and either combine or create a new Exhibition. --> The new workflow is a lot simpler yet more dynamic. Users were given a lot more freedom and flexibility, such as combining ArBytes directly from the home screen. The fixed header now gives a clear visibility of where the users are in the process of creating and provide flexibility to exit out from each step or move forward in the creating process.</p>

			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Artbytes will be developed as a native IOS over summer of 2016! It was a great experience to work with a real client for the first time and received an A as our final grade from our advisor :) </p>
			<p>Even though the creation aspect of Artbytes has been tested with confidence yet the team didn't get to spend much time on the exploring & social aspect of the App. Here are some sketches we had regarding the exploring feature. If given more time, I would really love to explore more ways to create the visual contents.</p>
