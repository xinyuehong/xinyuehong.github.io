			<div><h2>Spring 2016,<br> we brought our client Ali Momeni's concept of Artbytes to life.</h2>
			</div>
 			<p>It's an IOS App that encourages museum-goers to rethink what they see at art museums, create their own visual contents through simple cropping and combination, and share with the public using augmented reality. In this project, our main goal was to give anyone the confidence to be creative through simple and intuitive  design.</p>

				<!-- <h2>Background: A Client Based Product Redesign</h2> -->
				<!-- <p>Artbyte is a concept initially came up by Ali to help museum goers understand their own taste in Art. Ali approached us for help on re-validating and re-constructing his idea. After running heuristic evaluation and first round of user testing on the initial app, we found that the initial version of Artbytes has very low usability and the overall workflow was confusing for users</p> -->
			</div>


			<div><h2>Defining Painpoints:<br> Museum going Experience is passive</h2>
			</div>
			<p class="pbetweenh3">We started the redesign process with relooking into the problems, After 20+ interviews, countless trips to art museums/galleries and became "stalkers" for ten weeks straight, we defined these problem spaces.</p>
	<!-- 		<img src="img/researcha.png" alt="" class="eightywidth">
	 --> 	<div><h3>1. Passive Engagement</h3></div>
	 		<p class="pbetweenh3">Although the experience is engaging in the moment, visitors leave the museum space with all this documentation but are unlikely to reflect on it after</p>
	 		<div><h3>2. Exclusive Art</h3></div>
	 		<p class="pbetweenh3">In terms of art, access is limited to the museum or gallery, making the experience of viewing art exclusive. In fact, some of the most innovative and creative art is proprietary, making it difficult to engage with regularly.</p>
	 		<div><h3>3. Disconnected Experience</h3></div>
	 		<p class="pbetweenh3">	While each gallery can provide an interesting experience, museum-goers often have difficulty connecting experiences across museums. Experiences within museums can become very isolated and solitary</p>

					<h3>Temporary Engagement</h3><br>
					<p>going to a museum can be extremely passive. Oftentimes, individuals in museums walk through exhibits and document things they enjoy by taking pictures, jotting down information, or sharing their thoughts with a friend. Although the experience is engaging in the moment, visitors leave the museum space with all this documentation, but is unlikely to reflect on it after.</p>

				<h2>Design Insights & Ideation</h2>
				<p>During our preliminary search,  we focused on understanding the population of museum-goers and how technology has enhanced the museum experience in the past. Beyond gaining an understanding of our audience, we found, through expert interviews and a thorough literature review, that The use of technology to be worthwhile, it must encourage careful thought and personal expression. From what we learned in the past, technology can often be distracting and take away from the purpose of a museum experience. These are two goals of art-seekers, and also goals of the institution.It must leverage existing museum-goer behavior. This includes social aspects as well as personal aspects, including documentation of experiences through photos. 
				Based on the existing App and research, we brainstormed and came up with 8 potential different features such as Artbytes grabbing & sharing, virtual reality gallery for viewing.</p>

				<p>After the brainstorming session based on our design synthesis,We decided to use two ways storyboarding and experimental workshops to rapidly prototype our ideas. From these tests, we learned that people love the idea of Augmented reality and are eager to share, yet they think they might not be confident enough to create art since the creation process might be difficult.</p>

			<!-- <h2>Rapid Prototyping of ideas</h2>
			<p>We used mainly two ways, storyboarding and experimental workshops to rapid prototype our ideas. From speed-dating,
			we heard “I love the idea of creating my own visual contents based on museum experience but it seems like a lot of work”
			“I don’t think I’m creative enough to do it.”
			We learned People loved the idea of sharing and finding Artbytes using augmented reality and find it a novel and exciting experience, yet it takes a while to let users understand the concept of Augmented Reality. One concern we heard is that most people are afraid of the “creating” process would be complicated on a device and they are not creative enough to make their own art
			</p>
			<img src="img/janicea.png" alt="" class="eightywidth">
			<p>We then tested different ideas to see if cropping would be the easiest way to create art and if this interaction would actually help users think of what they like about art. From these little workshops, we learned that cropping method does help users think actively about the art while creating and gave users confidence in creation process."this is pretty fun actually." "Definitely not as hard as I thought it would be".</p>

			<div><h2>Reframe the problem:<br> Push for simple yet intuitive<br>interaction to lower the barrier of entry</h2></div>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">After speed dating and Art-making workshops, the team decided to put the whole design focus on prototyping the Artbytes creation and Gallery creation experience as we heard concerns that creating art might be difficult on a digital platform. We wanted to lower the level of entry of creation to the minimum to give users confidence in practicing their creativity and making this App for everyone.
				<!-- We tried paper prototype, marvel prototype, & finally code based prototpye, went through more than five rounds of iterations, think aloud & task based user testings & body-storming with more than 30 potential users. --></p>
			<p>The first version of the workflow of Artbytes used to be very linear and stringent. A lot of steps were mandatory and little affordances were given.The vocabularies we had such as “Artbytes” and “AR show” were hard to be understood by first users.</p>
			<img src="img/version3a.png" alt="" class="fullwidth">
			<p class="pbetweenimgs">While I brainstormed six different ideas to minimize the steps users have to go through in order to post exhibition and held a body-storming session with my friends to mimic different possible use scenarios. The practice was helpful as it let me focus on the option of “creating directly from my gallery" that further impacted the overall information architecture.</p>

			<!-- <h2>Key Final IXD decisions</h2>
			<h3>Simple Cropping Edge Tracing Method</h3>
			<p>The process of creating an ArtByte involves first selecting an image from your gallery or taking a picture with your phone’s camera. The user then crops out part of the image by outlining the desired section with their fingers. we found that users considered the two-step process tedious and time-consuming. Participants became frustrated that the app repeatedly crashed during the cropping process, particularly during the fine crop process, because none of their work had been saved. However, the bigger problem was that users did not understand why the app included two cropping stages. Because edge detection was buggy, and it was difficult to get an accurate outline in the coarse crop, users thought the distinction between coarse and fine crop was ambiguous. Participants found that this method was the most intuitive and that they were used to this method of cropping since it is similar to free-hand cropping in photo and image editing software and other mobile apps.</p><br>
			<h3>Removal of Combining step as mandatary</h3>
			<p>Our team decided to remove the mandatory step of combining ArtBytes, allowing for more flexibility in the creation process. In addition, we revised the app’s terminology by eliminating “Composition” as the term for multiple ArtBytes</p><br>
			<h3>Using Augmented Reality Posting Marker</h3>
			<p>For the final iteration, the ArtBytes application displays two separate visualizations, while the user locates a marker to post their exhibition. The first, a visualization of a scan of the camera view, indicates that the application is assisting in locating a viable marker. The camera display then displays points of interest (POIs) on objects, generated by the Augmented Reality Vuforia SDK. Utilizing this feature of the SDK allows users to continuously and instantly see how good of a location the current camera is displaying. Once an acceptable threshold of POIs are found, the user will have be given the option to post their exhibition.</p><br>
			<h3>A much more dynamic Workflow</h3>
			<p>In the final version, the workflow eliminates the step of creating the composition and allows the users to make an Exhibition with single ArtByte. After creating an ArtByte, the users can now select the Artbyte and either combine or create a new Exhibition. The new workflow is a lot simpler yet more dynamic. Users were given a lot more freedom and flexibility, such as combining ArBytes directly from the home screen. The fixed header now gives a clear visibility of where the users are in the process of creating and provide flexibility to exit out from each step or move forward in the creating process.</p>

			<div><h2>What's next? <br> Artbytes is coming!</h2></div>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Artbytes will be developed as a native IOS over summer of 2016! It was a great experience to work with a real client for the first time and received an A as our final grade from our advisor :)</p>
			<p>Even though the creation aspect of Artbytes has been tested with confidence yet the team didn't get to spend much time on the exploring & social aspect of the App. Here are some sketches we had regarding the exploring feature. If given more time, I would really love to explore more ways to create the visual contents.</p>
